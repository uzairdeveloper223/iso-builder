######

This ISO builder creates bootable LimeOS installation media. It uses
`debootstrap` to build a minimal Debian-based rootfs, then produces two systems
from it: a target rootfs (the OS that gets installed) and a live rootfs (the
live installer that runs from the ISO). The final output is a hybrid ISO image
that supports both BIOS and UEFI boot.

> This application is still a **work in progress**. Some features may be
